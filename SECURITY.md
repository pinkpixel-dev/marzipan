# Security Policy

We take the security of our project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@example.com**

Please include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and assess the issue (e.g., affected versions, configuration, proof‑of‑concept, and potential impact). Do not open a public GitHub issue or share details publicly until we have had a chance to investigate and release a fix.

**For urgent security issues**, please include "URGENT SECURITY" in the email subject line.

### What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected versions or components
- Potential impact assessment
- Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)
- Your contact information for follow-up questions

## Response Time and Updates

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**
- **Regular Updates**: We will provide updates on our investigation progress
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical security issues as quickly as possible

## Handling Process

Our security response process includes:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We confirm receipt of your report and begin our investigation
2. **Assessment**: We evaluate the severity and impact of the reported vulnerability
3. **Development**: If confirmed, we develop and test a fix
4. **Coordination**: We coordinate with you on responsible disclosure timing
5. **Release**: We release the fix and publish security advisories as appropriate
6. **Follow-up**: We follow up to ensure the issue is fully resolved

## Non-Security Issues

If we determine that a reported issue is not a security vulnerability, we will let you know and may suggest filing a regular GitHub issue instead.
