## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Marzipan, please report it via one of the following confidential channels:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** (recommended): Use the “Report a vulnerability” feature on the Marzipan repository: https://github.com/pinkpixel-dev/marzipan/security/advisories/new
- **Email**: Send details to `admin@pinkpixel.dev` with the subject line `Security issue in Marzipan`

Please include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and assess the issue (e.g., affected versions, configuration, proof‑of‑concept, and potential impact). Do not open a public GitHub issue or share details publicly until we have had a chance to investigate and release a fix.

### Response Time and Updates

- We aim to acknowledge all vulnerability reports within **3 business days**.
- After initial acknowledgment, we will provide status updates **at least once per week** while the issue is being investigated and remediated.

### Handling Process

1. **Triage and validation** – We review the report, attempt to reproduce the issue, and assess its severity and impact.
2. **Remediation** – We develop and test a fix or mitigation, and prepare a release or advisory as appropriate.
3. **Disclosure** – Once a fix or mitigation is available, we will:
   - Publish a security advisory via GitHub Security Advisories, and
   - Communicate any recommended upgrade or mitigation steps.
4. **Credit** – Where appropriate and if you wish, we may credit you in the security advisory for responsibly disclosing the issue.

If we determine that a reported issue is not a security vulnerability, we will let you know and may suggest filing a regular GitHub issue instead.
4. You can expect an initial response within 48 hours
5. We will provide regular updates on the investigation progress
6. If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure
7. If the report is declined, we will provide an explanation

For urgent security issues, please include "URGENT SECURITY" in the email subject line.
